# The emotional impact of the Covid-19

This repository contains both the final dissertation and the slides for the presentation for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Trento.

## Traineeship project

This dissertation describes in detail the activity performed during my two-month traineeship at the Big Data & Data Science Department of Eurecat - Centro Tecnológico de Catalunya, which was supervised by Cristian Consonni and David Laniado. The purpose of the project was to analyze the emotions emerging from Twitter messages during the pandemic, in order to understand how people felt over the whole period. Based on the result obtained from this research, it may be possible to determine which countermeasures better handled the situation while offering the best possible trade-off between people’s satisfaction and the reduction of the spread of the disease.

## Special Thanks 

I would like to thank first of all Prof. Montresor, who gave me the possibility to carry out my traineeship with Eurecat - Centro Tecnológico de Catalunya. Secondly, both Cristian Consonni and David Laniado, who supervised my work at the Big Data & Data Science Department, and always helped me during my traineeship to get the best possible experience. Finally, my family, who always supported me during these years in every way possible, and my friends, both in the university and in my hometown: even though I am aware that I complain a lot, you have really made these three years more enjoyable.

Once again, thanks for believing in me.
